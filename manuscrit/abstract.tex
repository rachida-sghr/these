\chapter*{Abstract}

We propose a framework that facilitates modeling Enterprise Architectures (EA) by automating analysis, prediction, and simulation to address the key issue of business/IT alignment. Smart Grids are power grids enabled with Information and Communication Technologies. Extensive studies try to foresee the impacts of Smart Grids on electric components, telecommunication infrastructure, and industrial automation and IT.

Our message is that Smart Grids have also impacts on the overall EA of grids operators. Therefore, our framework enables stakeholders to validate and criticize their modeling choices for the EA in the context of Smart Grids. It is a multi-view framework regarding three aspects ⎯ information, processes, and goals ⎯ for each view. We add an integration view to ensure inter- and intra-view consistency. We rely on Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques to ease the holistic modeling and simulation of enterprise systems. Finally, we show the utility of our approach by applying it on a Smart Grid case study~: the management of electric vehicules fleet.
