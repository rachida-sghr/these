\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{otherlanguage}{english}
In this thesis, we propose a framework that facilitates modeling Enterprise Architectures (EA) by automating analysis, prediction, and simulation, in order to address the key issue of business/IT alignment. We present our approach in the context of Smart Grids, which are power grids enabled with Information and Communication Technologies. Extensive studies try to foresee the impact of Smart Grids on electric components, telecommunication infrastructure, and industrial automation and IT.

However, Smart Grids also have an impact on the overall EA of grids operators. Therefore, our framework enables stakeholders to validate and criticize their modeling choices for the EA in the context of Smart Grids. What we propose is a multi-view framework with three aspects -- information, processes, and goals -- for each view. In addition to the business, functional and application views, we add an integration view to ensure inter and intra-view consistency. We rely on Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques to ease the holistic modeling and simulation of enterprise systems. Finally, we show the utility of our approach by applying it on a Smart Grid case study: the management of an electric vehicules fleet.
